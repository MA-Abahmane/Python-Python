### Requirments
IDE
<br>
Python

### Snake Movement:

The snake is controlled by arrow keys, responding to user input for direction changes.
It moves continuously, and the challenge is to navigate and avoid collisions with the walls and itself.

### Growth Mechanism:

As the snake consumes food items represented by, for example, apples, it grows in length.
Implementing a mechanism for growth adds complexity and engagement to the game.
Score Tracking:
A scoring system is implemented to keep track of the player's achievements.
Each successful consumption of food contributes to the overall score.

### Challenges Faced:

Debugging and refining the collision detection algorithm to ensure accurate gameplay.
Balancing the difficulty level to provide an enjoyable yet challenging experience for players.

### Learning Outcomes:

Enhanced proficiency in programming languages, especially in handling user input and game logic.
Improved problem-solving skills through addressing challenges in game development.
Conclusion:

In conclusion, the Snake Game project has been a rewarding endeavor, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical game development.
I hope you enjoy a quick demonstration of the game and appreciate the effort put into creating this classic yet captivating project.
Thank you for your attention, and I'm open to any questions¬†you¬†may¬†have!
